Introduction
============
I recently build up a game name dominos knight 2 on android platform. I build it from the scratch no existing graphical frame work has been used for the development of this game. In this game you have a main character called dominos which has to get all the coins that appears on the screen without touching obstacles. If you touch the obstacle then your life decreases one point. Next level automatically begins after user successfully gets all the coins that appear on the screen.
